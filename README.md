Building a no-frills PHP CRUD App with Routing from Scratch


2 folders have been uploaded as what was said in the tutorial was not working on my machine for 2 issues:

-  My database connection I had previous created at a password, "root", and was not blank as is in the     tutorial and by default. I changed this detail in the 'config.php' file to accommodate my machine.

-  Also, requiring files for pages needed just 1 '.' instead of 2 '..'. For example, 'require_once "../src/DBconnect.php";' was changed to 'require_once "./src/DBconnect.php";' to work on my machine.

'Tutorial-Exact' therefore should be marked as I assume that your machine will follow the set out parameters.
